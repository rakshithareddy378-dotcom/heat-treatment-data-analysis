# Effect of Heat Treatment Parameters on Hardness

## Objective
To analyze the effect of heat treatment temperature, cooling method, and impact energy on the hardness of a material using data analytics techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset contains heat treatment process parameters and mechanical properties, including:
- Heat treatment temperature (°C)
- Cooling method
- Hardness (HRC)
- Impact energy (J)

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Analysis Performed
- Comparison of average hardness for different cooling methods
- Analysis of hardness variation across heat treatment temperature ranges
- Study of the relationship between hardness and impact energy
- Correlation analysis between key variables

## Key Observations
- Moderate heat treatment temperatures result in higher hardness values.
- Faster cooling methods generally produce higher hardness.
- An inverse relationship exists between hardness and impact energy.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data analytics techniques can be applied to metallurgical process data to understand processing–property relationships and support data-driven decision-making.
